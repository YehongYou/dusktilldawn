## Dusk till dawn
This is a project aimed to help users searching for events ,selected by music type ,happening in Melbourne.
There are a few ways you can look for events though: through the search-bar, inserting the type of music you prefer, looking for your favourite bar/clubs and see if they have anything interesting going on.
It shows users also a map to check how far the place is, where the event is gonna happen , from their position.
Owner's clubs/bar have their own access to the website where they can manage their own venue and organise their own events.
